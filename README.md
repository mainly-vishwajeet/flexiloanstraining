## 🏦 RBI & Banking Fundamentals

### RBI & Money Concept

**Key Principle:** All money belongs to RBI (Reserve Bank of India)

- Money is **NOT a product** and cannot be sold
- Money can only be **transacted**
- Money can be **lent and repaid**
- Selling money is **NOT ALLOWED** as per RBI rules

### BFSI Framework

Money transactions are allowed only in these areas under RBI:

1. **Banking** - All banks
2. **Financial Services** - NBFCs (Flexi Loans, Muthoot, etc.)
3. **Services Sector**
   - Schools
   - Colleges
   - Hotels
   - Restaurants
4. **Investments/Insurance**

### IT (Income Tax)
- IT department monitors and controls all financial activities

### NPCI (National Payments Corporation of India)
Manages banking transactions:
- UPI
- Net Banking
- Other digital banking transactions

### ECS (Earlier System) - Legacy
- NBFCs used **physical cheques** for loan distribution
- Cheque contained:
  - EMI amount
  - EMI date
  - Transfer authorization
  - Customer signature
- **Rule:** If loan has 24 EMIs but customer has only 12 cheques → NOT ELIGIBLE

### NACH (Current System)
Modern e-mandate system that replaced ECS:
- Works through **E-mandate** and **E-sign**
- EMI amount **automatically debited** from customer's bank account
- No physical cheque required

### Business Account Types

In Flexi Loans, customer distribution:
- **Current Account (CA):** 75% of applicants
- **Overdraft (OD):** 10% of applicants
- **Cash Credit (CC):** 15% of applicants

**Important Rule:** If customer has both Savings and Current Account:
- Ask which account has more transactions
- If Savings has more transactions → Advise customer to generate more transactions in Current Account for 6 months and contact again

## 💰 Loan Products & Features

### Loan Amount
**₹50,000 to ₹25,00,000**

### Tenure
**12 to 36 months**

### Interest Rates
**Flat Interest Rate:** 1% - 2% per month (12% - 24% per annum)

### Types of Rate of Interest (ROI)

#### 1. Flat ROI
- EMI remains constant every month
- Example:
  - Principal: ₹5,000
  - Interest: ₹1,600
  - Same amount every month

#### 2. Floating ROI
- Interest may increase or decrease based on market conditions

#### 3. Reducing ROI
- Interest decreases as principal reduces
- Example:
  - EMI 1: Principal ₹5,000 + Interest ₹1,600
  - EMI 2: Principal ₹5,100 + Interest ₹1,500

### Loan Type
- **Term Loan**
- **Unsecured Business Loan**
- Also called **SME / MSME Loan**

### Key Features
✅ 100% Digital Process  
✅ No Collateral Required  
✅ No EMI Locking  
✅ No Usage Restrictions  
✅ Quick Disbursal (24-48 hours)  
✅ Foreclosure/Pre-closure Available  

### EMI Calculation Example

**Formula:** (Principal + Interest Amount) ÷ Tenure

**Example:**
- Principal: ₹1,00,000
- Interest rate: 20%
- Interest amount: ₹20,000
- Total payable: ₹1,20,000
- Tenure: 24 months

**EMI = (₹1,00,000 + ₹20,000) ÷ 24 = ₹5,000**

### Processing Charges
- **Processing Fee:** 2.5% of loan amount
- **GST on Processing Fee:** 18%
- These charges are **deducted from principal** before disbursal
- Remaining amount is credited to customer's account

### Foreclosure / Pre-closure
If customer pays the **entire outstanding loan amount at once** before tenure completion:
- Called **Foreclosure** or **Pre-closure**

### Gold Loan Rule
- Only **ONE active gold loan** is eligible
- More than one gold loan → Loan NOT approved
